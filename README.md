# Memory-Pool
This project is to create a memory pool for fast allocation.
The motivation for this project is to understand what to memory pool work.
Also to how it is benifit for real-time application.
After finished the basic functions, it inspires me to save data as binary and load it back to memory.
If this idea works, it mean I can load data directly without parse from some sources.
